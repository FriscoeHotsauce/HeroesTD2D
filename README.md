# Heroes Tower Defense 2D

Heroes TD but 2D this time

In Heroes Tower Defense, the player controls a small band of heroes as they desperately try and reach the capital before a marauding undead army sieges the city. Battles play out on focused battlefieds where the player must position their heroes intelligently to make the most of their unique abilities.

## Current Development Status

Heroes Tower Defense is a working title, and very much a work in progress. Currently I am working on a vertical slice, focusing on building out game systems instead of content.
